Hi, I'm a scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab working on remote sensing systems. A physicist by training, I received my Ph.D. from UIUC where I researched quantum materials. I enjoy using a data-driven approach to tackle applied science problems.

This website is a place to document my notes on machine learning and post personal projects. I'm mainly interested in computer vision, but am always learning and will also write about data science, signal processing, and reinforcement learning.

Hi, I'm a physicist at Northrop Grumman working on alternative computing platforms. Previously I was a Senior Staff Scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab working on remote sensing systems. I received my Ph.D. from UIUC where I researched quantum materials. I enjoy using a data-driven approach to tackle applied science problems.

This website is a place to document my notes on machine learning/data science and post personal projects. I am always trying to learn more about data science, data engineering, and machine learning to discover something new or make my life a little easier.
